				<li><p>In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called Emperor Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard Emperor client.The client application was created by Emperor Inc. of Chennai, INDIA, in May 2020.</p></li>
				<li><p>It became the world's most popular messaging application by 2020 and has over 2 billion users worldwide as of September 2020.It has become the primary means of electronic communication in multiple countries and locations, including Latin America,the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa</p></li>
				<li><p>Emperor was founded in 2020 by TAUQEER ALI.</p></li>
				<li><p>This idea that Emperor are defined simply by their ability to bring people together has been seen as too broad, as this would suggest that fundamentally different technologies like the telegraph and telephone.This terminology is unclear, with some early researchers referring to social media as social networks or social networking services.[4] A more recent paper from 2020 reviewed the prominent literature in the area and identified four common features unique to then-current Emperor services:</p></li>
				<li><p>The development of Emperor started off with simple platforms.Unlike instant messaging clients, such as ICQ and AOL's AIM, or chat clients like IRC, iChat or Chat Television, Emperor was the first online business that was created for real people, using their real names.</p></li>
				<li><p>Emperor Networking Revolution has led to the rise of networking sites. thus proving how popular Emperor platforms have become. This increase is because of the widespread daily use of smartphones through web.</p></li>
				<li><p>Emperor are used to document memories, learn about and explore things, advertise oneself and form friendships as well as the growth of ideas from the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and sites. Networked individuals create, edit, and manage content in collaboration with other networked individuals. This way they contribute to expanding knowledge.</p></li>
